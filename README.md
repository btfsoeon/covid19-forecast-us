## Purpose

This project aims to predict COVID-19 infection in the US, 
hoping schools are going to be open soon.

For now (4/2/2021), more than 31 million people are infected in the US.
Cases have slowed down as vaccination distribution has been sped up. 
However, there are still other risks such as variants.


## Literature Review

The standard epidemiological models such as SIR, SEIR, and etc. have been challenged 
regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. 
Due to the complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, 
many studies suggest machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.
